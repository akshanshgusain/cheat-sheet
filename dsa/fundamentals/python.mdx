# Python Fundamentals for LeetCode & DSA Interviews

Python’s expressive syntax and rich standard library make it ideal for coding interviews.

## 1. Comprehensions & Unpacking

### List Comprehensions
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
evens = [x for x in arr if x % 2 == 0]    # [2, 4]
squares = [x*x for x in arr]             # [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

### Dict & Set Comprehensions
```python
pairs = [('a',1), ('b',2)]
d = {k: v for k,v in pairs}               # {'a':1, 'b':2}
unique = {x for x in arr if x%2==0}       # {2, 4}
```

### Tuple Unpacking
```python
x, y = 5, 10
x, y = y, x       # swap: x=10, y=5
a, b, *rest = [0, 1, 2, 3]  # a=0, b=1, rest=[2, 3]
```

### Generators
```python
gen = (x*x for x in range(100))  # generator expression

def gen_range(n):
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        yield i
        i += 1
```

## 2. Iteration & Functional Tools

### `enumerate()`
Definition: `enumerate()` returns pairs of (index, value) from an iterable, allowing you to loop with both the index and the value.
```python
for i, val in enumerate(['a','b','c'], start=1):
    print(i, val)
```

### `zip()`
Definition: `zip()` aggregates elements from two or more iterables (like lists or tuples), returning tuples with one element from each iterable.
```python
a = [1,2,3]; b = ['x','y','z']
for num, ch in zip(a, b):
    print(num, ch)
```

### `map()` and `filter()`
Definition: `map()` applies a function to every item in an iterable and returns a map object (which can be converted to a list). `filter()` filters items in an iterable based on a function that returns True or False.
```python
doubles = list(map(lambda x: x*2, arr))
odds = list(filter(lambda x: x%2, arr))
```

### `any()` and `all()`
Definition: `any()` returns True if at least one element in the iterable is true. `all()` returns True if all elements in the iterable are true.
```python
any(x < 0 for x in arr)
all(x is not None for x in arr)
```

### `sorted()`, `reversed()`, and `sum()/min()/max()`
Definition: `sorted()` returns a new sorted list from the items in an iterable. `reversed()` returns an iterator that accesses the given sequence in the reverse order. `sum()`, `min()`, and `max()` return the sum, minimum, and maximum of an iterable, respectively.
```python
sorted(arr)
sorted(arr, reverse=True)
sum(arr); min(arr); max(arr)
list(reversed(arr))
```

### `range()`
Definition: `range()` generates a sequence of numbers, commonly used for looping a specific number of times in for-loops.
- Remember: `range(n)` → `0..n-1`

### `itertools.chain()`
Definition: `itertools.chain()` takes multiple iterables and returns a single iterator that produces items from the first iterable until it is exhausted, then continues to the next iterable, and so on.
```python
from itertools import chain
nested = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
flat = list(chain.from_iterable(nested))  # [1,2,3,4]
```

## 3. Data Structures & Libraries

### `collections.Counter`
Definition: `collections.Counter` is a dict subclass for counting hashable objects. It returns a dictionary where elements are stored as keys and their counts as values.
```python
from collections import Counter
cnt = Counter([1,2,2,3,1,1])
cnt.most_common(2)  # [(1, 3), (2, 2)]
```

### `collections.defaultdict`
Definition: `collections.defaultdict` is a dict subclass that provides a default value for nonexistent keys, avoiding KeyError.
```python
from collections import defaultdict
group = defaultdict(list)
for k,v in pairs:
    group[k].append(v)
```

### `collections.deque`
Definition: `collections.deque` is a double-ended queue that supports fast appends and pops from both ends.
```python
from collections import deque
q = deque([start])
while q:
    node = q.popleft()
    q.append(next_node)
```

### `heapq` (min-heap)
Definition: The `heapq` module provides an implementation of the min-heap queue algorithm, also known as the priority queue algorithm.
```python
import heapq
heap = []
heapq.heappush(heap, 5)
heapq.heappush(heap, 1)
heapq.heappop(heap)  # 1
```

### `bisect`
Definition: The `bisect` module provides support for maintaining a list in sorted order without having to sort the list after each insertion.
```python
import bisect
a = [1,3,4,7]
i = bisect.bisect_left(a, 5)
a.insert(i, 5)  # [1,3,4,5,7]
```

## 4. Pythonic Idioms & Techniques

### Sorting with `key=`
```python
people = [('alice',25), ('bob',20)]
people.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort by age
min(people, key=lambda x: x[1])
```

### Lambda expressions
```python
lambda x: x[1]
```

### `enumerate()` + `zip()` unpacking
```python
for idx, (x, y) in enumerate(pairs):
    ...
```

### `functools.lru_cache` for memoization
Definition: `functools.lru_cache` is a decorator that caches the results of function calls, so that when the same inputs occur again, the cached result is returned instead of recomputing.
```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def fib(n):
    ...
```

## 5. Common Pitfalls

### Mutable Default Arguments
```python
# Bad
def f(a=[]): a.append(1); return a

# Good
def f(a=None):
    if a is None:
        a = []
    a.append(1)
    return a
```

### Shallow vs Deep Copy
```python
a = [[1,2],[3,4]]
b = list(a)          # Shallow copy
b[0][0] = 9
# a becomes [[9,2],[3,4]] — wrong!

import copy
b = copy.deepcopy(a)  # Deep copy
```

### Off-by-One Errors
- `range(n)` is `0..n-1`
- `range(len(arr))` is correct
- Be careful with `<=` vs `<`

### Integer Division
```python
5 / 2  # 2.5
5 // 2  # 2 (correct for integer division)
```

### List Multiplication Pitfall
```python
# Wrong
matrix = [[0]*m]*n

# Correct
matrix = [[0]*m for _ in range(n)]
```

### `is` vs `==`
```python
a == b  # value equality
a is b  # identity (same object)
```

## 6. Best Practices

- Use comprehensions (`[x for x in ...]`)
- Prefer built-ins: `Counter`, `min`, `max`, `sum`, `sorted`
- Use `defaultdict` for grouping
- Use `heapq.nlargest` / `nsmallest` for "top K" problems
- Sort with `key=` function
- Cache expensive calls with `@lru_cache`
- Avoid unnecessary loops with `map`, `filter`, `zip`, `enumerate`
- Keep code readable and Pythonic
