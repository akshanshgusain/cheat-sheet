## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
**‚ÄúSubtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.‚Äù**
In practice, any class inheriting from a base class should be able to behave as the base class type without surprises or
broken expectations.

### Purpose
* Guarantees reliable polymorphism ‚Äì you can use a subclass wherever a base class is expected, without needing special case handling.
* Exposes bad inheritance designs: if a subclass cannot fully substitute for its parent type (i.e., it violates expected behavior or contracts), the design should be reconsidered.
* Ensures that derived classes extend (or specialize) base behavior without weakening or contradicting it (e.g., honoring all the base class‚Äôs invariants, postconditions, etc.).

### Minimal Example
A classic `LSP` violation is modeling a `Square` as a subclass of `Rectangle`. A `Rectangle` might allow independent width and
height changes, but a `Square` (where width == height) can‚Äôt fully satisfy that contract. In the code below, notice that
substituting a `Square` into a function that expects a `Rectangle` breaks the expected behavior (the assertion fails).
This shows `Square` is not a true LSP-compliant subtype of `Rectangle`.
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
    def set_width(self, w):
        self.width = w
    def set_height(self, h):
        self.height = h
    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

class Square(Rectangle):
    def __init__(self, side):
        super().__init__(side, side)
    def set_width(self, w):
        # Override: keep square sides equal
        self.width = w
        self.height = w
    def set_height(self, h):
        self.width = h
        self.height = h

def set_width_and_check_height(rect: Rectangle):
    original_height = rect.height
    rect.set_width(rect.width + 5)
    # In a true Rectangle, changing width shouldn't affect height.
    assert rect.height == original_height, "Height changed: LSP violated!"

rect = Rectangle(10, 2)
set_width_and_check_height(rect)    # Passes, height stays the same

sq = Square(5)
set_width_and_check_height(sq)      # Fails, Square.set_width altered the height
# AssertionError: Height changed: LSP violated!
```

### More Realistic Example
Consider a file writer API. A base class `FileWriter` provides a write() method. We might be tempted to create a
`ReadOnlyFileWriter` subclass that, say, throws an error on write. However, doing so means a `ReadOnlyFileWriter` cannot
actually substitute for a `FileWriter` ‚Äì any code expecting a FileWriter would break if given the read-only variant.
This violates LSP.
```python
class FileWriter:
    def write(self, data):
        print(f"Writing data: {data}")

class ReadOnlyFileWriter(FileWriter):
    def write(self, data):
        # This subclass cannot fulfill the base class contract for write()
        raise IOError("Cannot write to a read-only file")

def save_data(writer: FileWriter, data):
    # Assumes any FileWriter passed in can write data
    writer.write(data)

# Using a normal FileWriter works:
w = FileWriter()
save_data(w, "Hello World")  # Output: Writing data: Hello World

# Substituting a ReadOnlyFileWriter breaks the expected behavior:
rw = ReadOnlyFileWriter()
save_data(rw, "Test")        # Raises IOError - not actually substitutable
```
<Info>
    üí° LSP in practice: The example above suggests that ReadOnlyFileWriter shouldn‚Äôt subclass FileWriter at all.
    Perhaps ReadableFile and WritableFile interfaces should be separate. Following LSP often guides us toward better
    abstractions or the Interface Segregation Principle, described next.
