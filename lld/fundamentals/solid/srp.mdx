## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
**"A class should have only one reason to change.”** In other words, each class or module should focus on a single
responsibility or functionality.

### Purpose
* Ensures high cohesion by keeping classes focused on one task or role.
* Makes code easier to maintain and less prone to bugs – a change affecting one responsibility won’t unexpectedly impact others.
* Simplifies testing, since each class has a small, well-defined behavior to verify.

### Minimal Example
Below, `TextManager` violates `SRP` by handling both text processing and file saving. We then refactor into two classes
(`TextProcessor` and `TextFileSaver`), each with a single responsibility (one for text manipulation, one for persistence).
```python
# SRP Violation: one class handling two different responsibilities
class TextManager:
    def __init__(self, text):
        self.text = text

    def to_uppercase(self):
        # Responsibility 1: text processing
        self.text = self.text.upper()

    def save(self, filename):
        # Responsibility 2: saving to a file (unrelated to text processing)
        with open(filename, 'w') as f:
            f.write(self.text)

# SRP Compliance: split into two classes, each with a single responsibility
class TextProcessor:
    def __init__(self, text):
        self.text = text

    def to_uppercase(self):
        self.text = self.text.upper()

class TextFileSaver:
    def save(self, text, filename):
        with open(filename, 'w') as f:
            f.write(text)

```

### More Realistic Example
Consider a user account system. Originally, a `UserManager` class might both create users and send welcome emails – two
separate responsibilities. Applying `SRP`, we separate these concerns into a `UserManager` (handles user creation logic)
and an `EmailService` (handles email sending). The `UserManager` uses `EmailService` for notifications, but its own
responsibility is limited to user-related operations.

```python
class EmailService:
    def send_welcome_email(self, email):
        print(f"Sending welcome email to {email}...")

class UserManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.email_service = EmailService()

    def register_user(self, name, email):
        # Responsibility: create a new user (e.g., save to database)
        print(f"User '{name}' created in the system.")
        # Delegate email sending to EmailService (separate responsibility)
        self.email_service.send_welcome_email(email)

# Usage:
manager = UserManager()
manager.register_user("Alice", "alice@example.com")
# Output:
# User 'Alice' created in the system.
# Sending welcome email to alice@example.com...
```
