**Definition:**
“In object-oriented programming, polymorphism is the provision of one interface to entities of different data types.”

**Purpose & Benefits:**
- Flexibility and reuse through common interfaces.
- Method overriding.
- Reduced coupling.

**Examples:**

**Minimal Example:**
```python
class Dog:
    def speak(self):
        print("Woof!!")

class Cat:
    def speak(self):
        print("Meow!!")

for pet in [Dog(), Cat()]:
    pet.speak()
```

**Realistic Example:**
```python
class Manager:
    def do_work(self):
        print("Managing team")

class Developer:
    def do_work(self):
        print("Writing code")

staff = [Manager(), Developer()]
for member in staff:
    member.do_work()
```
