**Composition is a design principle where one class contains objects of other classes to reuse functionality instead of inheriting it.**

## Inheritance vs Composition

| Feature         | Inheritance                                | Composition                               |
|:----------------|:-------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------|
| **Goal**        | Reuse behavior via "is-a" relationship     | Reuse behavior via "has-a" relationship   |
| **Coupling**    | Tight coupling                             | Loose coupling                            |
| **Flexibility** | Less flexible to change                    | More flexible and modular                 |
| **Code Reuse**  | Inherits all parent behavior               | Reuses specific behavior only when needed |
| **Use When**    | Natural hierarchy exists                   | You want to compose behavior dynamically  |
| **Downsides**   | Fragile base class problem, tight coupling | May involve more boilerplate              |

## When to use Composition?
- You want to combine behaviors flexibly.

- You're designing for loose coupling and testability.

- You want to avoid unintended inheritance side effects.

## Inheritance vs Composition Minimal example

```python Inheritance
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Woof!")

dog = Dog()
dog.speak()  # Output: Woof!
```

```python Composition
class Engine:
    def start(self):
        print("Engine started")

class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        self.engine = Engine()

    def start(self):
        self.engine.start()

car = Car()
car.start()  # Output: Engine started

```
