## Abstraction
**“Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.”**

**Purpose & Benefits:**
- Focus on *what* an object does, not *how* it does it.
- Reduces system complexity and decouples modules.
- Encourages modularity and separates concerns.

**Examples:**

**Minimal Example:**
```python
class Shape:
    def area(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclass must implement area()")

class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self, side):
        self.side = side
    def area(self):
        return self.side ** 2

s = Square(5)
print(s.area())  # Output: 25
```

**Realistic Example:**
```python
class PaymentProcessor:
    def pay(self, amount):
        raise NotImplementedError

class PayPal(PaymentProcessor):
    def pay(self, amount):
        print(f"Processing ${amount} payment via PayPal")

class CreditCard(PaymentProcessor):
    def pay(self, amount):
        print(f"Processing ${amount} payment via Credit Card")

processor = PayPal()
processor.pay(100)
```
