ACID is a set of properties of relational database transactions.

Atomicity - Each transaction is all or nothing
Consistency - Any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another
Isolation - Executing transactions concurrently has the same results as if the transactions were executed serially
Durability - Once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so
