A document store is centered around documents (XML, JSON, binary, etc), where a document stores all information for a
given object. Document stores provide APIs or a query language to query based on the internal structure of the document
itself. Note, many key-value stores include features for working with a value's metadata, blurring the lines between
these two storage types.

Based on the underlying implementation, documents are organized by collections, tags, metadata, or directories. Although
documents can be organized or grouped together, documents may have fields that are completely different from each other.

Some document stores like `MongoDB` and `CouchDB` also provide a SQL-like language to perform complex queries. `DynamoDB`
supports both key-values and documents.

Document stores provide high flexibility and are often used for working with occasionally changing data.
