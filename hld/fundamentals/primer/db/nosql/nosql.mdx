NoSQL is a collection of data items represented in a key-value store, document store, wide column store, or a graph
database. Data is denormalized, and joins are generally done in the application code. Most NoSQL stores lack true ACID
transactions and favor eventual consistency.

`BASE` is often used to describe the properties of NoSQL databases. In comparison with the CAP Theorem, BASE chooses
availability over consistency.

- `Basically available` - the system guarantees availability.
- `Soft state` - the state of the system may change over time, even without input.
- `Eventual consistency` - the system will become consistent over a period of time, given that the system doesn't receive
input during that period.

In addition to choosing between SQL or NoSQL, it is helpful to understand which type of NoSQL database best fits your
use case(s). We'll review key-value stores, document stores, wide column stores, and graph databases in the next section.
